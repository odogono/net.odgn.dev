IDEO had developed an interactive outdoor 4 x 4 metre display which was deployed 
at the Vodafone headquarters in Lisbon.

As well as functioning as a typical billboard, it could at various times host apps 
and games which could be played by multiple users via mobile phones.

We were contracted to develop two games, Football Cubed and Spheretoy, working with IDEO designers 
as they built and tested the system.

## My Role

I implemented and co-designed the two apps. The first was a 3D football themed game, 
in which players raced to a given spot where the ball appeared in order to kick it 
into the goal. 

The second game was non-competitive, and involved bouncing a ball in a 3D cube while 
various effects were triggered.


## Tech Stack

Both apps were built using Adobe Director, written in Lingo and utilising the 3D 
extensions. A networking Xtra was employed to communicate with the controller and 
forward commands from incoming 
[DTMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling).


## What I learnt

The nature of the input device and display presented interesting problems to overcome. 
The DTMF technology used allowed any phone, mobile or otherwise, to be used. It did 
however have a noticeable latency, and so the game had to be adjusted to avoid too many 
quick actions.

While the screen was large (and so, so bright!), it was also situated a distance away 
from where the user was, and so it was not unlike developing for typical small mobile 
phone at the time.
