The Zentrack system is a workforce management tool designed for businesses to track, control, 
and report on their various workflows.

The App offers a focussed, work ready, view for a given users assigned jobs and workflows, 
allowing them to view and respond to upcoming events, and complete assessment forms which 
are then submitted to the main system.

Much like the systems CMS, the app was designed to be white-labelled, allowing the appearance 
and behaviour to be modified for a given company.


<div className="app-screens flex flex-row gap-2 mb-8">
<ImageModal src={imageApp1} alt="App Screen" width={140} height={300} fit="cover" />
<ImageModal src={imageApp2} alt="App Screen" width={140} height={300} fit="cover" />
<ImageModal src={imageApp3} alt="App Screen" width={140} height={300} fit="cover" />
<ImageModal src={imageApp4} alt="App Screen" width={140} height={300} fit="cover" />
</div>

## My Role

I implemented apps for iOS, Android, and web. The functionality centred around forms and the 
entry of different types of information using various control types.

Because the app was expected to function in areas where connectivity could be poor, it was 
designed to be offline-first, and would submit jobs and forms when a network connection became 
available.

Sitting in-between the system and the apps, I developed a proxy server which condensed and 
collated various data into a mobile sensitive format. It also handled incoming notifications 
from the main system and forwarded them on to the relevant push systems for each OS.


## Tech Stack

The app was implemented using React Native, with the web version using React, but sharing a 
lot of the non-presentational code.

The server was written in NodeJS and also shared the same (Redux based) data model with 
the app.
