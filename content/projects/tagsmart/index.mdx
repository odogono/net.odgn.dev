The Tagsmart app was designed to be a used as a guide and browser for galleries. It 
utilised iBeacons, GPS, and QR codes in order to determine the closest item of interest
and then respond and display relevant content. 


<div className="app-screens flex flex-row justify-evenly mb-8">
    <ImageModal src={imageApp1} alt="App Screen" width={140} height={300} fit="cover" />
    <ImageModal src={imageApp2} alt="App Screen" width={140} height={300} fit="cover" />
</div>

## My Role

I developed the iOS app in Objective-C, and worked with iBeacon hardware to find a 
workable sensing solution.
