SSFM was a massively multiplayer football management game. 
Players could choose a club to manage in one of several ‘worlds’ competing against others to win the 
leagues and cups, and the chance to be promoted into silver and gold worlds. 

Using a Windows PC client, players would connect to the servers to perform typical manager tasks 
with their teams in preparation for matches. The Matches themselves were played in (sped-up) 
realtime, scheduled for specific times of the day.

To support large numbers of players, the concept of ‘worlds’ was used. This is similar to 
how ‘shards’ work in other multiplayer games. A Meta-Game interface would allow the player 
to choose a world to inhabit based on the availability of a team and the number of players in that world.

A companion web site supported the game with forums and the ability to view the state of worlds.

## My Role

As the lead online developer, my primary role was to develop the meta-game and support services. 
This put me right in the centre of the development, and so worked with the design team from an 
early stage as well as the other technical teams in order to get everything talking well.

I was also involved with the selection of server hardware (Sun, later linux) to run the system, and 
then in the lead-up to launch with the deployment and management.

## Tech Stack

The technology evolved from the previous [DOTN]('./dotn') project, which was Java based, 
albeit a single running executable. 

Because certain parts were written in different languages, 
this led to employing what would now be considered a 
[Microservices](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) based approach. 
Distinct processes were used for the game engine, authentication, and load balancing. 
These were tied together using the Meta-game service which would ‘orchestrate’ the game engine 
processes and work with the database.

A benefit of this approach was being able to scale easily
across multiple servers. The system in production used 4 servers - one for database (SQL Server), 
two for game servers, and one for the website.


The game engine was licensed from a 3rd party and was C++ based. Around this the team developed a 
wrapper which would allow network communication.

A ‘switching server’ was developed in C++ which allowed incoming packets from the client to be 
directed to either the meta-game service or the game engine. It authenticated users with a separate 
authentication service (Java).

The Meta-game service was written in Java. It handled incoming commands from the client, match 
result data from the game engine, the launching of game engine processes, marshalling of data to and 
from the database, and a sort of peer to peer communication with other Meta-game services.

Other Java based services were written to handle authentication (with the database), and also 
load balancing and redirection.



## What I learnt

The scale of the project was an order of magnitude greater than my previous. The team was larger, 
and I had some management responsibilities for other technical members. 

The architecture of the system (the meta-game concept) was largely my contribution, although 
it was with the benefit of a great team of smart people that it came to fruition.

Despite being a long time fan of football management games, I largely had (and still have), an 
indifference to football as a sport. The passion and tribal nature of football gave a couple 
of headaches.
My favourite was the ‘Man Utd’ problem - every player wants to manage their own team and we, as 
a service they pay for, should be able to offer them want they want. This however would lead to 
the problem of having a great number of worlds with only a single human player. Not great for 
them, and not great for us in terms of cost. 
Early design meetings would present this as an insurmountable problem. In the end, it turned out 
that players would be more than willing to accept managing lesser teams, providing they had the 
opportunity at some point to move up.
