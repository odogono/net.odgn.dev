MCM was an update of an existing game which ran on feature phones. The player manages 
a chosen football team in a bid to win, whilst pitted against other teams controlled 
by AI or other players.

The iOS version of the game took the existing design and adapted it for the iphone. 
Arcade style mini-games allowed the user to improve the fitness and skill of their 
players. A messaging system allowed simple inter-player communication, and taking 
advantage of Push notifications to alert players of upcoming matches.

The match engine used was the same used on SSFM, but was already embedded in their 
web application. The server components we wrote would interface with the engine in 
a similar way.

## My Role

I was contracted to write the iOS app and the server. Other members of the team wrote 
the mini-games which I then integrated into the application. 


## Tech Stack

The iOS application was a mixture of Objective-C, C++, and Lua. The scripting language 
Lua was used for the logic of the app, while ObjC/C++ for platform tasks and 
[XMPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP) networking.

The server was built around the XMPP server [ejabberd](https://www.ejabberd.im/). 
XMPP gave a solid foundation on which to implement game commands while getting 
features such as presence and chat built in.

The game server logic, and interfaces to mail and push notifications, were implemented 
in Ruby. CouchDB was used as the database.
